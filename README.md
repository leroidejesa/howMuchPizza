#####KNOWN BUGS/THINGS TO FIX SOON<br>
* Order menu stretches across the screen at certain screen sizes
* Order summary is in desperate need of a makeover

#####FUTURE GOALS/IMPROVEMENTS<br>
* Dropdown for selecting multiple toppings
* Nav bar or side bar
* Something beer-related, maybe the ability to view current tap list
* More jQuery!
