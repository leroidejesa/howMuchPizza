Originally completed as a `JavaScript`/`jQuery` exercise at [Epicodus](http://epicodus.com), Portland, Oregon. Nowadays I put in a commit or two from time to time, (very slowly) chipping away old stuff and playing around with its code or making it look better. I'd like to someday turn it into a full-blown app with elements related to pizza, beer, and anything else you might find on a real brewpub's website.
<br><br>
#####DESCRIPTION<br>
It's a simple app where users can calculate the final order cost of pizza(s) based on quantity, size, and toppings. 

Preview on [BitBalloon™](http://pizzaandbeer.bitballoon.com/) or follow instructions below:
````
1. Clone repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enjoy!
````

#####KNOWN BUGS/THINGS TO FIX SOON<br>
* Order menu stretches across the screen at certain screen sizes
* Order summary is in desperate need of a makeover

#####FUTURE GOALS/IMPROVEMENTS<br>
* Dropdown for selecting multiple toppings
* Nav bar or side bar
* Something beer-related, maybe the ability to view current tap list
* More jQuery!
