Originally completed as a one-day `JavaScript`/`jQuery` assignment at [Epicodus](http://epicodus.com), Portland, Oregon. I like to add a commit or two from time to time though, (very slowly) chipping away old stuff and playing around with new code. Maybe someday it'll turn into a full-blown app.
<br><br>
#####DESCRIPTION<br>
It's a website where users can calculate the final order cost of pizza(s) based on quantity, size, and toppings.

Preview on [BitBalloon™]() or follow instructions below:
````
1. Clone repository.
2. Open `pizza.html` in your browser.
3. Enjoy!
````

####FUTURE GOALS/IMPROVEMENTS<br>
*Stylized order summary
*Dropdown for selecting multiple toppings
*Nav bar or side bar
*Something beer-related, maybe the ability to view current tap list
*More jQuery!
